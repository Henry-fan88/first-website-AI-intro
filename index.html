    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Tech -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is structured into thematic, navigable sections to transform the linear manual into an engaging, explorable experience. A sticky top navigation allows users to jump to any topic. The AI Development Lifecycle is presented as an interactive flowchart, making the process-oriented information easier to digest. AI careers and products are shown in a card-based grid for visual clarity. The AI model comparison is a dynamic section with a chart that updates on user interaction. This structure was chosen to break down the information into manageable, interactive modules, which is more effective for learning and retention than a simple text document. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        1. AI Lifecycle: Report Info -> 6 stages of development. Goal -> Explain a process. Viz -> Interactive HTML/CSS flowchart. Interaction -> Click a stage to see details. Justification -> Better than a list for showing a sequence. Method -> Vanilla JS, HTML/CSS.
        2. Key Professionals: Report Info -> List of AI roles. Goal -> Inform about careers. Viz -> Grid of cards. Interaction -> Click to expand details. Justification -> Visual and encourages exploration. Method -> Vanilla JS, HTML/CSS.
        3. AI Models: Report Info -> Comparison table. Goal -> Compare models. Viz -> Bar chart + text description area. Interaction -> Buttons filter content and update chart. Justification -> Makes comparison dynamic and visual. Library -> Chart.js.
        4. AI Products: Report Info -> Bulleted lists of examples. Goal -> Showcase applications. Viz -> Icon-based cards in a grid. Interaction -> Simple hover effects. Justification -> More scannable and visually appealing than text lists. Method -> HTML/CSS.
